To ensure a smooth and professional development process, I used ChatGPT as a coding assistant throughout this project. It helped me by:

Guiding me on responsive layout design tailored for both desktop and mobile views.

Assisting in writing clean, Tailwind CSS classes for precise positioning and styling.

Offering real-time debugging suggestions when layout or overflow issues occurred.

Helping document the code and structure in a clear, maintainable way.

With ChatGPTâ€™s support, I was able to deliver this project faster, more efficiently, and with polished results.
